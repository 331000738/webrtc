## WebRTC DevTools ##

Is a chrome devtools extension that aims at helping develop WebRTC apps in chrome.
Once installed as an extension in chrome it adds a WebRTC tab to devtools that allows
to manipulate and inspect peer connections created on the tab.

It works by reloading the target page with injected javascript that wraps RTCPeerConnection
with code that allows the devtools WebRTC tab to inspect details of the created connections.
