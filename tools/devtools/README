## WebRTC Tools ##

Is a chrome extension that intends to be a placeholder for tools that help
developping WebRTC apps in chrome. For now the only use is to inject modified
peer connection settings.

# How to use:
 - Use "Load unpacked extension" from chrome://extensions in developer mode to
   load the extension from a local copy of this project in the browser.

 - Modify override.js settings part with desired behaviour to inject.

 - Extension is configured to only run in localhost pages, you can change so in
   manifest.json

 - Certain modifications may require the extension to be reloaded. That is easy
   achievable on the chrome://extensions page.

 - Remember to disable the extension once finished with testing or it will
   affect every peer connection on the matching url patterns.
