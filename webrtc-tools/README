## WebRTC Tools ##

Is a chrome extension that intends to be a placeholder for tools that help
developping WebRTC apps in chrome. For now the only use is:

Help testing TURN configurations:
  When active this extension hijacks every call to addIceCandidate and drops
  non-relay candidates. Thus when installed and active in both peers of a
  connection it forces the media plane to go through TURN servers, since no
  peer connection is aware of the non-relay candidates of other candidates.
